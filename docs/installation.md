# Installation guide

This guide walks you through installing K-Dense BYOK from scratch. No coding experience is needed — if you can copy and paste commands into a terminal, you can do this.

## 1. Check your computer

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Operating system** | macOS or Linux. On Windows, install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) first and run everything inside it. |
| **Node.js ≥ 22.19** | The startup script installs it for you via Homebrew on a Mac if it's missing. On Linux, install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it. |
| **git** | Pre-installed on most systems. On a Mac, run `xcode-select --install` if it's missing. |

Everything else (Python tooling, packages, scientific skills) is installed automatically the first time you start the app.

## 2. Get an OpenRouter API key

K-Dense BYOK is "Bring Your Own Keys": the app is free, and you pay only for the AI model usage on your own account.

1. Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) and sign up.
2. Add a small amount of credit (a few dollars is plenty to start).
3. Create an API key and copy it — it looks like `sk-or-...`.

OpenRouter is a single account that gives you access to models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Qwen, and more, so you don't need separate accounts with each provider.

> **Prefer not to pay anything?** You can run the app entirely on free local models instead — see [Local models with Ollama](./local-models-ollama.md). In that case you can skip the OpenRouter key.

## 3. Download the project

Open a terminal (on a Mac: press `Cmd+Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok.git
cd k-dense-byok
```

This downloads the project into a folder called `k-dense-byok` and moves you into it.

## 4. Add your API key

In the project folder there is a template file called `.env.example`. Copy it to a file called `.env` (note the dot at the start):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in any text editor and paste your OpenRouter key:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-key-here
```

That's the only key you need. If you skip this step, the startup script creates the `.env` file for you and reminds you — and you can also paste the key later inside the app under **Settings → API keys**.

## 5. Start the app

```bash
./start.sh
```

The first run takes a few minutes. The script automatically:

- checks for and installs anything missing (Node.js on a Mac, the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python manager that Kady uses to run analyses),
- installs the backend and frontend packages,
- downloads the catalogue of 140+ scientific skills,
- creates your `.env` file if you haven't, and warns you clearly if no API key (or local Ollama) is set up.

When it finishes, your browser opens to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** — that's the app. Future starts take only a few seconds.

To stop the app, go back to the terminal and press **Ctrl+C**.

## 6. Optional API keys

These unlock extra capabilities. All of them can be added later in **Settings → API keys** — none are required to get started.

| Key | What it adds | Where to get it |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Exa** | Direct web + code search with neural retrieval tuned for scientific content. Web search works without it via a free fallback. | [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) |
| **Perplexity** | Alternative web search with synthesized, cited answers. | [perplexity.ai/settings/api](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api) |
| **Gemini** | Search fallback plus YouTube / video understanding. | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |

The `.env` file also lists keys for specific scientific databases (NCBI, Materials Project, openFDA, FRED, NASA, and many more). You only need those if a task touches the corresponding database and it asks for one.

## Updating to a new version

From the project folder:

```bash
git pull
./start.sh
```

The startup script picks up any new packages and skills automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- **`./start.sh: Permission denied`** — run `chmod +x start.sh` once, then try again.
- **Browser doesn't open** — go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) manually.
- **"No API key" warning** — make sure your key is in `.env` (the file is `.env`, not `.env.example`), or paste it in **Settings → API keys** inside the app.
- **Port already in use** — the startup script clears leftover Kady processes automatically and names any other program holding port 3000 or 8000. Quit the program it names (or set `KADY_PORT` in `.env` to move the backend) and run `./start.sh` again.
- **Something else?** — [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok/issues); we read every one.
