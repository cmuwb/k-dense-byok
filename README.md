**Your own AI research assistant, running on your computer, powered by your API keys.**

K-Dense BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) is a free, open-source app that gives you an AI research assistant called **Kady**. Ask Kady a question or give it a task, and it works in a full coding/research environment - reading and writing files, running code, and spinning up subagents for heavy or parallel work - to get you a thorough result. Kady is powered by the [Pi coding-agent SDK](https://pi.dev).

It is built for scientists, analysts, and curious people who want a powerful AI workspace without being locked into a single provider.

> **Stay up to date:** Follow K-Dense on [X](https://x.com/k_dense_ai), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/k-dense-inc), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@K-Dense-Inc) for release notes, tutorial videos, and workflow demos.

> **Beta:** K-Dense BYOK is currently in beta. Many features and improvements are on the way. [Star us on GitHub](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok) to stay in the loop.

## What can it do?

- **Answer questions and take on tasks.** Chat with Kady like any AI assistant. For bigger work, Kady uses its file and shell tools directly - and can delegate to sub-agents for independent or parallel subtasks - in a full working environment.
- **A built-in team of 21 scientific specialists.** Kady can hand work to expert sub-agents - a `citation-checker` that verifies every reference, a `statistical-reviewer` that audits your analysis, a `peer-reviewer` that writes a journal-style report, and 18 more. They run one at a time, in parallel, or chained. You can view, edit, and create your own in Settings. [Learn more](./docs/sub-agents.md).
- **Connect external tools with MCP.** Add [MCP servers](./docs/mcp-servers.md) (an open standard supported by hundreds of services) from Settings to give Kady extra abilities - web search, GitHub, reference managers, databases, and more - with a built-in connection tester.
- **Run up to 10 chats in parallel.** Open a new tab for each thread of work — every tab keeps its own message history, model, attached files, and cost meter, but all tabs share the project's sandbox so files written in one tab are immediately available in the others. Tabs keep streaming in the background while you switch between them.
- **Pick any tool-capable AI model, any time.** Choose from the full set of OpenRouter models that support tool calling (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Qwen, and more) with a simple dropdown, per chat tab. You can also use free local models through [Ollama](./docs/local-models-ollama.md).
- **140+ scientific skills, pre-installed.** Covers genomics, proteomics, drug discovery, materials science, and more. Kady activates the right skills automatically for each task.
- **326 ready-to-run workflow templates.** Browse a built-in library across 22 disciplines - genomics, drug discovery, finance, astrophysics, and more. Pick one, fill in the blanks, and launch.
- **229 scientific and financial databases.** Connect to databases in 18 categories - Biomedical & Health, Chemistry & Materials, Scholarly Publications, Stock Market, Earth & Climate, Astronomy & Space, and more.
- **Organise your work in projects.** Each project has its own files, chat history, and settings. Upload files, browse folders, preview documents, and download results - all from inside the app.
- **Rich file previews.** Built-in viewers for code, Markdown (with math and diagrams), CSVs, PDFs, images, Jupyter notebooks, and bioinformatics formats (FASTA, FASTQ, VCF, BED, GFF, SAM, BCF).
- **LaTeX editor.** Split-pane editor with live PDF compilation (pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX).
- **Voice input, drag-and-drop attachments, `@` file mentions,** and a **message queue** for batching up to 5 messages while the agent is working.
- **Cost & budget tracking.** Per-session and per-project cost meters, plus an optional hard spend cap per project.

> Native web search (Exa/Parallel), literature search (Paperclip), document conversion, remote compute (Modal), browser automation, and the provenance/"Copy as Methods" export are being re-added in upcoming releases. (In the meantime, many of these are available today by connecting an [MCP server](./docs/mcp-servers.md).)

## What you'll need before starting

| What | Why | Where to get it |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| A computer running **macOS or Linux** | The app runs locally on your machine | Windows works too - use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) |
| An **OpenRouter API key** | This is how the AI models are accessed | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) - sign up and create a key |
| An **Exa API key** *(optional)* | Lets Kady search the web with neural (embedding-based) retrieval tuned for scientific content | Get your Exa API key: [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) |
| A **Parallel API key** *(optional)* | Alternative web search provider | [parallel.ai](https://parallel.ai/) |
| A **Paperclip API key** *(optional)* | Biomedical literature, regulatory documents, and clinical-trial search | [paperclip.gxl.ai](https://paperclip.gxl.ai/) |
| **Modal** credentials *(optional)* | Only needed for remote GPU/CPU compute | [modal.com](https://modal.com/) |

You do not need any coding experience. The startup script installs everything else for you.

## Install and run

### Step 1 - Download the project

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok.git
cd k-dense-byok
```

### Step 2 - Add your API keys

In the project's top folder you'll find a file called `.env.example`. Make a copy and rename it to `.env` (note the dot at the start). Open `.env` in any text editor and paste your **OpenRouter API key** - that's the only key you need to get started. (If you skip this step, the startup script creates the `.env` file for you and reminds you to add the key - you can also paste it later in **Settings → API keys**.)

Optionally set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to use local models with no API key at all - see [Local models with Ollama](./docs/local-models-ollama.md).

### Step 3 - Start the app

```bash
./start.sh
```

The first time you run this, it automatically checks for and installs everything the app needs - the backend and frontend packages, the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python manager Kady uses to run analyses, and the scientific skills. It also creates your `.env` file if you haven't yet, and warns you clearly if no API key (or local Ollama) is set up. This may take a few minutes; future starts are much faster. (You'll need Node.js ≥ 22.19 installed - the script installs it via Homebrew on a Mac if missing.)

Once everything is running, your browser will open to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. That's the app.

### Step 4 - Stop the app

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal.

## Using the app day to day

- **Send a message.** Type a question or task and hit enter. Kady answers directly, runs tools (read/write files, run code), and can delegate to specialist sub-agents for heavy or parallel subtasks - or you can name one yourself: *"have the citation-checker go through manuscript.md"*.
- **Open multiple chats.** Click `+` in the chat tab strip to start a new chat in the same project (up to 10). Double-click a tab title or use the pencil icon to rename it. Closing a tab cancels any turn it had running. The cost pill in the header shows both the active tab's session cost (`sess`) and the project total across every tab (`proj`).
- **Switch models.** Use the model dropdown in the input bar - any message can use any tool-capable OpenRouter model, or a local Ollama model.
- **Upload files.** Drag files into the file browser or directly onto the input bar. Use `@filename` in your message to reference files.
- **Launch a workflow.** Open the workflows panel, pick one, fill in the blanks, and click Launch. Workflows run in whichever chat tab is currently active.
- **Open Settings** (the gear icon in the top-right) to manage your API keys, connect [MCP servers](./docs/mcp-servers.md), view and customize [sub-agents](./docs/sub-agents.md), and change the appearance.
